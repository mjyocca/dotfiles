# Personal Dotfiles Config Project

Dotfiles managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). Configuration lives in `packages/` and is symlinked to `$HOME` via `make dotfiles`.

## External File Loading

CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @rules/general.md), use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis. They're relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.

Instructions:

- Do NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need
- When loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults
- Follow references recursively when needed

## docs/ Reading Policy

- `docs/instructions/` — agent-facing. Load on demand when relevant to the task.
- `docs/reference/` and all other `docs/` subdirectories — human-facing reference material. Do NOT read unless explicitly asked to.

## Project Structure

```
packages/          # Stow packages (each maps to $HOME paths)
  nvim/            # Primary config — Neovim (LazyVim-based)
  zsh/             # Shell config
  tmux/            # Terminal multiplexer
  gitconfig/       # Git config
  ssh/             # SSH config
  starship/        # Prompt theme
  ghostty/         # Terminal emulator
  asdf/            # Version manager
  homebrew/        # Brewfile
  opencode/        # AI assistant config
  ...
osx/               # macOS-specific defaults & bootstrap scripts
scripts/           # Utility scripts (stow.sh, plugins.sh, etc.)
Makefile           # Command entrypoint
```

### Commands

All commands run through the Makefile:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `make dotfiles` | Stow all packages into `$HOME` (skips packages in `.stow-ignore.local`) |
| `make stow PKG=<name>` | Stow a single package by name (e.g. `make stow PKG=nvim`) |
| `make stow PKG="a b c"` | Stow multiple specific packages |
| `make bootstrap` | Full machine provisioning (platform-aware) |
| `make apply_settings` | Apply OS-level defaults (macOS only currently) |

#### Per-machine package ignore list

Create a `.stow-ignore.local` file at the repo root to skip packages on a
specific machine. The file is git-ignored and never committed.

```
# .stow-ignore.local — example for a work machine
# One package name per line. Blank lines and # comments are ignored.
zsh
homebrew
```

`make dotfiles` reads this file automatically and skips any listed packages.
`make stow PKG=<name>` always bypasses the ignore list.

### Neovim

Primary editor config located at `packages/nvim/.config/nvim/`. Key areas:

- `lua/config/` — core options, keymaps, autocmds
- `lua/plugins/` — plugin definitions (lsp, ai, coding, editor, ui, etc.)
- `lua/lang/` — LSP configuration per language (each file configures a language server: typescript, ruby, golang, rust, lua, bash, markdown, mdx, terraform, c, sorbet, ember, ember_glint, base)

When working on any Neovim or Lua config task, load: @docs/instructions/neovim.md

### Zsh

Shell config located at `packages/zsh/`. Three-file layout:

- `.zshenv` — PATH and env vars for every shell context (scripts, cron, interactive)
- `.zshrc` — interactive shell only (prompt, plugins, tool hooks)
- `.zshrc.local` — per-machine overrides, git-ignored, auto-bootstrapped on first shell open

When working on any zsh config task, load: @docs/instructions/zsh.md

### Platform Support

- **macOS** — fully supported (`osx/` defaults, Homebrew bootstrap)
- **Linux** — targets exist in Makefile but not yet implemented

### `dotf` — daily-use toolbox

`dotf` is a dispatcher script stowed to `~/.local/bin/dotf`. It routes
subcommands to individual scripts in `~/.local/bin/dotf.d/`. Source lives at:

```
packages/scripts/.local/bin/
  dotf            # dispatcher — routes dotf <cmd> [args] to dotf.d/<cmd>
  dotf.d/         # one executable file per subcommand
    colima-use              # switch colima profile + docker context + socket
    colima-list             # list profiles, states, contexts
    colima-migrate-volumes  # export/import volumes between colima profiles
    nvim-project-init       # scaffold .envrc + .nvim.lua in a project root
```

Running `dotf --help` auto-lists all commands with their one-line descriptions
(pulled from the second line of each script).

**Adding a new subcommand:**

1. Create an executable file at `packages/scripts/.local/bin/dotf.d/<name>`
2. Line 1: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
3. Line 2: a `# <one-line description>` comment — this is what `dotf --help` prints
4. Run `make dotfiles` to stow it into `~/.local/bin/dotf.d/`

### Makefile vs. `dotf` — where to put new commands

| Criterion | Makefile target | `dotf` subcommand |
|---|---|---|
| Operates on the dotfiles repo itself | yes | no |
| Run during bootstrap / provisioning | yes | no |
| Needs to be available everywhere on the machine | no | yes |
| Used interactively during normal daily work | no | yes |
| Manages external tools (docker, colima, editors…) | no | yes |
| Accepts dynamic arguments / flags | awkward | natural |

**Use a Makefile target when** the command is about the dotfiles project:
provisioning a machine, stowing packages, applying OS defaults, installing
tools. These run once or rarely and operate on the repo itself.

**Use a `dotf` subcommand when** the script is a general-purpose utility that
should be available anywhere in a shell session: switching runtimes, managing
containers, scaffolding projects, or any workflow tool that travels with the
developer rather than the repo.

### Security Practices

Learnings from a security audit of this repo. Apply these when adding or
modifying any package config.

**Never commit secrets or credentials**
- Secrets, API keys, and tokens belong in `~/.zshrc.local` (git-ignored)
- Never put real values in `.zshenv` or `.zshrc` — those are committed
- The `.zshrc.local` bootstrap in `.zshrc` exists specifically for this

**Never hardcode usernames or absolute paths**
- Always use `$HOME` or `~` — never `/Users/<name>/...`
- Hardcoded paths break on other machines and leak identity in public repos

**Scope VM mounts tightly**
- Do not mount `/Users` (entire home directory) into a VM — it grants every
  process in the VM read/write access to `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.config`, etc.
- Scope colima mounts to specific project directories (e.g. `~/code`)
- Mounts in colima are mutable post-creation via `~/.colima/<profile>/colima.yaml`

**Do not commit runtime SSH includes**
- OrbStack and similar tools auto-inject `Include` directives into `~/.ssh/config`
- These reference runtime-generated files with internal hostnames and VM IPs
- Remove any auto-injected `Include` stanzas before committing `packages/ssh/.ssh/config`

**Keep git config email private**
- Use GitHub's noreply address format: `<id>+<username>@users.noreply.github.com`
- Never commit a real personal email address in `packages/gitconfig/.gitconfig`

**git-ignore all per-machine local files**
- `.stow-ignore.local` — machine-specific package ignore list
- `packages/zsh/.zshrc.local` — machine-specific shell overrides
- `packages/zsh/.global_env.sh` — legacy, replaced by `.zshrc.local`

---

### Conventions

- Each `packages/<name>/` directory mirrors the `$HOME` path structure for Stow
- No manual symlinks — always use `make dotfiles`
- Platform-specific logic belongs in `osx/` (later: `linux/`)
